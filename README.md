<h1>About</h1>
<p><b>DROPPUA</b> is a site that can share both text and files in real-time! Just enter text into the textbox, upload files using the inuitive <a href=https://pqina.nl/filepond/>Filepond</a> interface. In just moments, another user from a different device can read shared text or download shared files, all without reloading the page. To acomplish this, Server-Sent Events were used and delivered using a PHP stream from data stored in a MySQL database.</p>
<h1>Integrations</h1>
<p>Ease of use was a top priority in mind when creating <b>DROPPUA</b>. Along with the easy to use interface all on one page, there are integrations that have been made to work with the app.</p>
